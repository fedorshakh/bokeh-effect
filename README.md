Source code of the program written as a test task for the course "Fundamentals of Deep Learning in Computer Vision".

The purpose of the task you want to create a script that will add the bokeh effect to an arbitrary
photo. Bokeh is when the photo is beautifully blurred, and circles appear in place of light sources, for example.

# Example:

Original image:
